LRU cache stand for Least Recently Used Cache. which evict least recently used entry.
 As cache purpose is to provide a fast and efficient way of retrieving data. it needs to meet a certain requirement.
Some of the Requirement are:
Fixed Size: Cache needs to have some bounds to limit memory usages.
Fast Access: Cache Insert and lookup operation should be fast, preferably O(1) time.
Replacement of Entry in case, Memory Limit is reached: A cache should have an efficient algorithm to evict the entry when memory is full.
Please design that in future it might support LFU - Least Frequently used
