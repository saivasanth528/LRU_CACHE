# LRU_CACHE

LRU cache stand for Least Recently Used Cache. which evict least recently used entry. As cache purpose is to provide a fast and efficient way of retrieving data. it needs to meet a certain requirement.
Some of the Requirement are <br/>
1. Fixed Size: Cache needs to have some bounds to limit memory usages.<br/>
2. Fast Access: Cache Insert and lookup operation should be fast, preferably O(1) time.<br/>
3. Replacement of Entry in case, Memory Limit is reached: A cache should have an efficient algorithm to evict the entry when memory is full.
